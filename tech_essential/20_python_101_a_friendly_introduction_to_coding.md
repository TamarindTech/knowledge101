# **🐍 Python 101: A Friendly Introduction to Coding**

**💡 What Is Python?**

**Python** is a popular, beginner-friendly programming language known for being:

✅ Easy to read\
✅ Great for web, data, AI, automation\
✅ Used by Google, NASA, Netflix, and more!

🧠 Python reads almost like English — that’s why it’s great for first-time coders.

**🧱 What Can You Build with Python?**

|**Use Case**|**Example**|
| :- | :- |
|Web Apps|Flask, Django|
|Data Science|Analyze numbers with pandas|
|Machine Learning|Train AI with scikit-learn or TensorFlow|
|Automation|Rename files, scrape websites|
|Games|Build simple 2D games with pygame|

**🖥️ Your First Python Program**

print("Hello, world!")

This tells the computer to **print a message** to the screen.\

**🧠 Python Basics**

**✅ Variables**

Store information:

name = "Aung"

age = 20

**🔄 If Statements**

Make decisions:

if age >= 18:

`    `print("You're an adult!")

else:

`    `print("You're still young!")

**🔁 Loops**

Repeat something:

for i in range(3):

`    `print("Repeat:", i)

**🧰 Functions**

Reusable blocks of code:

def greet(name):

`    `print("Hello", name)

greet("Chris")

**

**🧩 Python Data Types**

|**Type**|**Example**|
| :- | :- |
|**String**|"Hello"|
|**Integer**|42|
|**Float**|3\.14|
|**Boolean**|True, False|
|**List**|[1, 2, 3]|
|**Dictionary**|{"name": "Aung"}|

**🛠️ Working with Lists**

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

print(fruits[0])  # apple

fruits.append("orange")

**📦 Bonus: Try a Simple Project**

🎯 **Goal**: Build a number guessing game

import random

secret = random.randint(1, 10)

guess = int(input("Guess a number (1–10): "))

if guess == secret:

`    `print("You got it!")

else:

`    `print("Try again. The number was", secret)

**🧰 Tools to Write Python**

|**Tool**|**Use Case**|
| :- | :- |
|**Replit**|Run Python in the browser|
|**Thonny**|Simple Python IDE for beginners|
|**VS Code**|Powerful code editor|
|**Jupyter**|Interactive notebooks (great for data)|
