# **🔐 Cybersecurity 101: Protecting Yourself in the Digital Age**

**💡 What Is Cybersecurity?**

**Cybersecurity** is the practice of protecting **computers**, **networks**, **data**, and **systems** from:

- Unauthorized access
- Cyberattacks
- Data theft or damage

“Just like you lock your door at night, you need to secure your digital life too.”

**🔥 Why Cybersecurity Matters**

|**Risk**|**Example**|
| :- | :- |
|Identity Theft|Someone steals your personal info|
|Phishing|Fake emails tricking you into giving info|
|Ransomware|Hackers lock your files for money|
|Data Breach|Hackers steal data from companies|
|Social Engineering|Psychological tricks to get passwords|

**🧱 The Cybersecurity Triangle (CIA Triad)**

|**Element**|**What It Means**|
| :- | :- |
|**C – Confidentiality**|Keep data private (e.g. passwords, files)|
|**I – Integrity**|Ensure data is accurate and untampered|
|**A – Availability**|Ensure systems are up and running when needed|

**

**🔑 Basic Cybersecurity Concepts**

|**Concept**|**Description**|
| :- | :- |
|**Authentication**|Confirming identity (e.g. login credentials)|
|**Authorization**|What someone is allowed to access|
|**Encryption**|Turning data into secret code|
|**Firewall**|Blocks unauthorized access to your system|
|**Malware**|Malicious software (virus, trojan, spyware)|
|**Antivirus**|Software that detects and removes malware|
|**VPN**|Secure, private connection over public networks|

**🧠 Common Types of Cyberattacks**

|**Attack Type**|**Description & Example**|
| :- | :- |
|**Phishing**|Fake emails or links to steal data|
|**Ransomware**|Files are locked and held for ransom|
|**DDoS**|Server flooded with traffic to crash it|
|**Brute Force**|Trying many passwords until one works|
|**Zero-Day Exploit**|Attack before a system flaw is patched|

**

**🔒 How to Protect Yourself (Simple Tips)**

|**Category**|**Best Practices**|
| :- | :- |
|**Passwords**|Use strong, unique passwords. Try a password manager.|
|**Software**|Keep everything updated (OS, apps, antivirus)|
|**Devices**|Lock your phone/laptop, turn off Bluetooth when not in use|
|**Wi-Fi**|Use WPA3 encryption, change default router passwords|
|**Email**|Don’t click suspicious links. Verify the sender.|
|**Backup**|Keep a backup of important files (offline/cloud)|

**🔐 Strong Password Guidelines**

✅ Use at least 12 characters\
✅ Mix letters, numbers, and symbols\
✅ Avoid using names or birthdays\
✅ Use a password manager (e.g., Bitwarden, 1Password)

Example:

P@s$w0rD\_21! → ❌ Too predictable  

Mango#7Dolphin\_42! → ✅ Better

**🧪 Try It Yourself: Cyber Hygiene Checklist**

☑️ Do I use a unique password for every site?\
☑️ Is 2FA (two-factor authentication) enabled on my accounts?\
☑️ Are my devices encrypted and auto-locking?\
☑️ Do I review app permissions?\
☑️ Is my software up to date?

**

**🧰 Tools for Personal Cybersecurity**

|**Tool**|**Purpose**|
| :- | :- |
|Bitwarden, 1Password|Store and manage passwords securely|
|Google Authenticator|Two-factor authentication (2FA)|
|Malwarebytes|Detect and remove malware|
|ProtonMail / Tutanota|Encrypted email|
|NordVPN / Mullvad|Browse privately and securely|

**🧠 Careers in Cybersecurity**
