# **🎨 Design Thinking 101: Solving Problems Creatively & Empathetically**

**💡 What Is Design Thinking?**

**Design Thinking** is a problem-solving approach that focuses on **understanding users**, **challenging assumptions**, and **creating innovative solutions** through experimentation and iteration.

“It’s not just about designing things — it’s about designing the *right* things, for real people.”

**🧠 Why Use Design Thinking?**

|**Traditional Approach**|**Design Thinking**|
| :- | :- |
|Start with tech|Start with **user needs**|
|Fixed specs|Flexible and evolving|
|Linear process|Iterative and experimental|
|Build first, test later|Prototype **early**, test often|

**🚶 The 5 Stages of Design Thinking**

|**Stage**|**Goal**|**Tools/Examples**|
| :- | :- | :- |
|1\. **Empathize**|Understand your users’ world|Interviews, observation, journey maps|
|2\. **Define**|Frame the right problem|Problem statement, user personas|
|3\. **Ideate**|Generate creative solutions|Brainstorming, mind mapping|
|4\. **Prototype**|Make rough versions to test ideas|Paper sketches, mockups, MVPs|
|5\. **Test**|Get feedback from real users|Usability testing, A/B testing|

🔁 **Design Thinking is iterative** — you can jump back and forth between stages.

**🧩 Let’s Walk Through an Example**

🎯 Problem: Students struggle to stay focused during online learning.

**1. Empathize**

- Interview students: “What’s hard about online classes?”
- Observe: Distractions, passive learning, lack of feedback

**2. Define**

- *“Students need a more engaging and interactive online learning experience.”*

**3. Ideate**

- Ideas: Pomodoro timers, gamification, peer study groups

**4. Prototype**

- Build a clickable Figma mockup of an online class dashboard

**5. Test**

- Have real students use it → record reactions → improve it

**✍️ Sample Problem Statement Format**

“***[User]*** needs a way to ***[user’s need]*** because ***[insight]***.”

Example:

“Remote students need a way to stay engaged during class because they feel isolated and distracted.”

**💭 Key Mindsets in Design Thinking**

|**Mindset**|**What It Means**|
| :- | :- |
|💛 Human-centered|Focus on empathy, real users, real pain|
|🧪 Experiment-driven|Test ideas early and often|
|🔁 Iterative|Learn through feedback and adjust quickly|
|🌱 Growth mindset|There is no failure, only learning|
|👯 Collaboration|Work in cross-functional teams|

**🧰 Tools & Templates**

|**Tool**|**Use Case**|
| :- | :- |
|Empathy Map|Capture user feelings/needs|
|User Persona|Represent a typical user|
|Journey Map|Visualize user experience timeline|
|Crazy 8s|Generate 8 ideas in 8 minutes|
|Low-Fi Prototypes|Paper or Figma mockups|
|Testing Scripts|Prepare questions for usability test|

**🛠 Hands-On Activity: "Redesign a Commute"**

1. Interview a friend about their daily commute
1. Write a problem statement
1. Sketch 2–3 potential solutions
1. Pick one and make a paper prototype
1. Test your idea and ask: “What could make this better?”

**💬 Final Thought**

“Design thinking teaches you to **fall in love with the problem**, not just the solution.”

It’s not about being a designer — it’s about being curious, empathetic, and creative in **how you solve real-world problems**.
