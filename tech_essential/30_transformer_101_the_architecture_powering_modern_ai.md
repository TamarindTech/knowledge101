# **🤖 Transformer 101: The Architecture Powering Modern AI**

**💡 What Is a Transformer?**

A **Transformer** is a deep learning architecture introduced by Google in 2017, designed to process sequences of data (like text or time series) using **attention** — not recurrence (like RNNs).

🧠 Transformers are the brains behind ChatGPT, BERT, DALL·E, Gemini, Claude, and more.

**Famous paper:**\
📄 *“Attention is All You Need”* — Vaswani et al., 2017

**🧠 Why Are Transformers Special?**

|**Feature**|**Traditional Models (RNNs/LSTMs)**|**Transformers**|
| :- | :- | :- |
|🧱 Sequence Handling|One step at a time (slow)|Entire sequence in parallel|
|⏳ Long-Range Memory|Struggles with long input|Handles long-range dependencies|
|⚡ Speed|Sequential (slow to train)|Parallelized (fast on GPUs)|
|🔁 Recurrence|Yes|❌ None — uses attention instead|

**🔍 Core Components of a Transformer**

**1. Input Embedding**

- Converts words into vectors (numbers)
- Adds **positional encoding** to understand order

**2. Self-Attention**

- Each word “looks at” every other word in the sentence to decide what matters
- Computes **attention weights**

“I went to the **bank** to deposit money.”\
→ Attention helps the model know "bank" means financial institution, not riverbank.

**3. Multi-Head Attention**

- Runs multiple attention mechanisms in parallel to capture different types of relationships

**4. Feedforward Network**

- Each position gets passed through a small neural network

**5. Layer Norm + Residuals**

- Stabilizes learning and allows deeper networks

**⚙️ Transformer Architecture (Encoder-Decoder)**

|**Encoder**|**Decoder**|
| :- | :- |
|Reads the input sequence|Generates the output sequence|
|Used in BERT, CLIP|Used in GPT, ChatGPT|

📌 **BERT** = only encoder\
📌 **GPT** = only decoder\
📌 **T5 / BART** = both encoder + decoder

**🎯 Applications of Transformers**

|**Use Case**|**Model Example**|
| :- | :- |
|Text generation|GPT, Claude|
|Translation|Google Translate, MarianMT|
|Search/QA|BERT, Cohere|
|Code generation|CodeBERT, Codex|
|Vision & multimodal|Flamingo, Gemini, CLIP|

**🔢 Sample: How Attention Works (Simplified)**

Sentence: "The cat sat on the mat."

Self-attention for “sat”:

\- “The” → 0.1

\- “cat” → 0.6 ✅

\- “sat” → 0.2

\- “on” → 0.05

\- “mat” → 0.05

→ "sat" attends most to "cat" to understand subject-verb relationship.
