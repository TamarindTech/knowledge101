# **🐹 Golang 101: A Beginner’s Guide to Go Programming**

**💡 What Is Go?**

**Go (aka Golang)** is an open-source programming language developed at Google.

It is known for being:

- ✅ Simple
- ⚡ Fast
- 🧱 Strongly typed
- 🌐 Great for web, APIs, microservices, and concurrent systems

🧠 Think of Go as **C-level performance** with **Python-level simplicity**.

**🌟 Why Learn Go?**

|**Advantage**|**Why It Matters**|
| :- | :- |
|🚀 Fast Performance|Compiles to machine code (no interpreter)|
|💼 In-Demand|Used by companies like Google, Uber, Twitch|
|🧩 Easy Syntax|Minimalistic, beginner-friendly|
|🧵 Built-in Concurrency|Handle many tasks at once|
|⚙️ Great for Backends|APIs, CLI tools, servers|

**👋 Your First Go Program**

package main

import "fmt"

func main() {

`    `fmt.Println("Hello, Go!")

}

**🔤 Go Syntax Basics**

**✅ Variables**

var name string = "Aung"

age := 21 // short declaration

**🔄 If Statements**

if age >= 18 {

`    `fmt.Println("Adult")

} else {

`    `fmt.Println("Minor")

}

**🔁 Loops (only for)**

for i := 0; i < 3; i++ {

`    `fmt.Println(i)

}

**🧰 Functions**

func greet(name string) {

`    `fmt.Println("Hi", name)

}

**🧱 Go Data Types**

|**Type**|**Example**|
| :- | :- |
|int|42|
|float64|3\.14|
|string|"hello"|
|bool|true or false|
|[]string|A slice (like an array)|
|map[string]int|Key-value store|

**📦 Packages and Imports**

All Go code is organized into **packages**. Every file starts with:

package main

Import external or standard libraries like:

import "fmt"

import "math"

**🕹️ Go Concurrency with Goroutines**

go sayHello() // runs in the background

Go makes it easy to run code **concurrently** (at the same time) with **goroutines** and **channels** — great for servers!

**

**🛠 Go Tools and Ecosystem**

|**Tool / Feature**|**What It Does**|
| :- | :- |
|go run|Run your Go file|
|go build|Compile to a binary|
|go fmt|Auto-format code|
|go mod|Dependency and module management|
|go test|Run unit tests|

**💼 What Can You Build with Go?**

|**Project Type**|**Examples**|
| :- | :- |
|**APIs & Web Servers**|REST APIs, GraphQL backends|
|**CLI Tools**|Custom command-line apps|
|**Microservices**|Small, scalable cloud apps|
|**Cloud Native Apps**|Docker, Kubernetes (written in Go)|
|**Networking Tools**|Proxies, HTTP clients, servers|

**🧪 Mini Project Ideas**

- Build a CLI calculator
- Create a “Quote of the Day” API
- Write a program to check if a number is prime
- Build a REST API using the net/http package
