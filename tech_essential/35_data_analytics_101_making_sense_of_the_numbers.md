# **📊 Data Analytics 101: Making Sense of the Numbers**

**💡 What Is Data Analytics?**

**Data Analytics** is the process of **collecting**, **cleaning**, **analyzing**, and **interpreting data** to support better decisions.

“Data analytics helps us see what’s really happening — and what to do next.”

**🧠 Why Learn Data Analytics?**

|**Use Case**|**Purpose**|
| :- | :- |
|Business Decisions|Track trends, spot opportunities|
|Marketing|Analyze customer behavior|
|Product Management|See what features are working|
|Finance|Forecast revenue, spot anomalies|
|AI / ML|Feed models with clean data|

**🔍 The 4 Types of Data Analytics**

|**Type**|**Question Answered**|**Example**|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Descriptive|What happened?|“Sales dropped 5% last week”|
|Diagnostic|Why did it happen?|“Sales dropped due to ad budget”|
|Predictive|What will happen next?|“Sales will grow 10% next month”|
|Prescriptive|What should we do about it?|“Increase ad budget by 15%”|

**📦 Data Analytics Workflow**

**1. Collect Data**

- Sources: surveys, sales systems, web traffic, sensors, APIs
- Tools: Google Forms, SQL, web scraping, APIs

**2. Clean Data**

- Remove duplicates, fix typos, fill missing values
- Convert formats (e.g., date formats)

\# Example (Python + Pandas)

import pandas as pd

df = pd.read\_csv('sales.csv')

df.dropna(inplace=True)  # remove rows with missing data

**3. Analyze Data**

- Summarize: mean, median, count
- Group, compare, filter

**4. Visualize Data**

- Turn numbers into charts: bar, line, pie, heatmaps
- Tools: Excel, Google Sheets, Tableau, Power BI, Python, Looker

**5. Interpret & Act**

- Draw conclusions and make recommendations

**

**🔑 Key Concepts & Terms**

|**Term**|**Meaning**|
| :- | :- |
|Dataset|A table or collection of data|
|Variable|A column (e.g., “Age”, “Revenue”)|
|Observation|A row (e.g., one customer’s record)|
|Mean|Average|
|Median|Middle value|
|Correlation|How two variables move together|
|KPI|Key Performance Indicator (goal metric)|

**📊 Common Charts & When to Use Them**

|**Chart Type**|**Best For**|
| :- | :- |
|Bar Chart|Comparing categories|
|Line Chart|Trends over time|
|Pie Chart|Parts of a whole|
|Scatter Plot|Relationships between 2 variables|
|Histogram|Distribution of a variable|

**🔢 Essential Excel/Google Sheets Formulas**

=AVERAGE(A1:A10)   → Mean

=MEDIAN(A1:A10)    → Median

=COUNTIF(B1:B50, ">100") → Count values above 100

=IF(A1>50, "Pass", "Fail") → Conditional logic

=VLOOKUP(id, Table, 2, FALSE) → Join lookup

**🧪 Try This Hands-On**

1. Create a spreadsheet:
   1. Columns: Name, Age, Country, Spending
1. Use formulas to find:
   1. Average age
   1. Who spent the most
   1. Spending by country
