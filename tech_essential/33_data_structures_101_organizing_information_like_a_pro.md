# **🧱 Data Structures 101: Organizing Information Like a Pro**

**💡 What Are Data Structures?**

A **data structure** is a way of **organizing and storing data** so it can be used efficiently.

🧠 Think of data structures as containers: each one has a shape that fits a specific job.

**🧠 Why Are Data Structures Important?**

|**Use Case**|**Why It Matters**|
| :- | :- |
|Fast Search|Find a contact quickly (e.g. in a tree)|
|Efficient Storage|Save memory and optimize performance|
|Smart Organization|Represent real-world relationships|
|Algorithm Design|Many algorithms depend on the structure|

**📦 Core Types of Data Structures**

**1. Arrays and Lists**

|**Concept**|**Description**|**Code Example (Python)**|
| :- | :- | :- |
|**Array**|Fixed-size, indexable collection|arr = [10, 20, 30]|
|**List**|Dynamic size, often built-in|names = ["Amy", "Bo", "Cy"]|

Access by index: arr[0] = 10\
Use when: You need fast **index-based access**.

**

**2. Stacks and Queues**

|**Structure**|**Behavior**|**Analogy**|**Example Code (Python)**|
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
|**Stack**|LIFO (Last-In First-Out)|Stack of plates|stack.append(x); stack.pop()|
|**Queue**|FIFO (First-In First-Out)|Waiting in line|queue.append(x); queue.pop(0)|

Use stacks for **undo features**, queues for **task scheduling**.

**3. Linked List**

A list where **each item points to the next**.

[10] → [20] → [30] → None

Pros:

- Dynamic memory
- Easy insert/delete

Cons:

- Slower access than arrays

Use in: Low-level memory, queues, image editors

**4. Hash Tables (Dictionaries/Maps)**

Stores **key-value pairs** for fast lookup.

ages = {"Alice": 21, "Bob": 25}

print(ages["Bob"])  # 25

Constant time (O(1)) access in most cases!

Use in: Caching, databases, symbol tables

**5. Trees**

Hierarchical structure — like a **family tree**.

`        `A

`       `/ \

`      `B   C

`     `/ \

`    `D   E

Types:

- **Binary Tree**: 2 children max
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: Left < root < right
- **Trie**: Prefix tree for words
- **Heap**: Min/Max priority root

Use in: Search, sorting, AI, file systems

**6. Graphs**

A set of **nodes (vertices)** connected by **edges**.

|**Type**|**Description**|
| :- | :- |
|Directed|One-way connections (e.g. Twitter)|
|Undirected|Two-way (e.g. Facebook friendships)|
|Weighted|Edges have values (e.g. distances)|

Used for: Maps, social networks, recommendation engines

**7. Sets**

A collection of **unique items**, with fast operations like union/intersection.

a = {1, 2, 3}

b = {3, 4}

print(a & b)  # {3}

Use in: Filtering duplicates, fast lookups, math logic

**🧠 Big O: Why Performance Matters**

|**Operation**|**Array/List**|**Hash Map**|**BST (avg)**|**Linked List**|
| :- | :- | :- | :- | :- |
|Insert|O(1)|O(1)|O(log n)|O(1)|
|Search|O(n)|O(1)|O(log n)|O(n)|
|Delete|O(n)|O(1)|O(log n)|O(1)|

Choose the right data structure = faster, more efficient programs

**🧪 Practice Challenges**

1. **Stack Simulation:**
   1. Build a browser "Back" button with a stack.
1. **Queue Simulation:**
   1. Create a ticketing system with a queue.
1. **Hash Table Fun:**
   1. Store students’ names and scores.
1. **Tree Search:**
   1. Build a decision tree for a game (e.g. rock-paper-scissors outcomes).
1. **Graph Traversal:**
   1. Represent your friend circle and explore using BFS or DFS.
