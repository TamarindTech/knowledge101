# **🧠 Neural Network 101: The Brains Behind Modern AI**

**💡 What Is a Neural Network?**

A **neural network** is a type of machine learning model inspired by the **human brain**. It learns patterns in data by adjusting virtual “neurons” and their connections.

🧠 Just like the brain uses neurons to process information, neural networks use **artificial neurons** to make decisions and predictions.

**👶 Real-Life Analogy: Recognizing a Cat**

Imagine teaching a child to recognize a cat:

- You show many pictures 🖼️ of cats and dogs
- The child starts learning what a “cat” looks like
- Over time, they get better at predicting

This is how a neural network **learns from examples**.

**🧩 Neural Network Structure**

A basic neural network has 3 types of layers:

|**Layer Type**|**Purpose**|
| :- | :- |
|**Input Layer**|Takes in data (numbers, pixels, etc.)|
|**Hidden Layers**|Processes data through neurons|
|**Output Layer**|Produces the final result (e.g. cat or dog)|

Each **neuron** in a layer is connected to neurons in the next layer.

[Input] → [Hidden] → [Hidden] → [Output]

Each connection has a **weight**, which adjusts during learning.

**

**🔁 How Neural Networks Learn (Simplified)**

1. **Forward Pass**
   1. Input flows through the network.
   1. Each neuron computes:\
      **Output = activation(weight × input + bias)**
1. **Prediction**
   1. The network gives an answer (e.g., 90% cat, 10% dog)
1. **Loss Calculation**
   1. It checks how wrong the prediction was.
1. **Backpropagation**
   1. The network updates weights to improve next time.

📈 This cycle repeats thousands of times during training!

**🧠 Common Activation Functions**

|**Function**|**What It Does**|
| :- | :- |
|ReLU|Turns negative values to zero|
|Sigmoid|Squashes values 0 to 1|
|Softmax|Outputs probability scores|
|Tanh|Scales values from -1 to 1|

**

**🧮 Sample Python Code (with PyTorch)**

import torch.nn as nn

model = nn.Sequential(

`    `nn.Linear(4, 16),  # Input layer → Hidden layer

`    `nn.ReLU(),

`    `nn.Linear(16, 2),  # Hidden → Output (2 classes)

`    `nn.Softmax(dim=1)

)

**🧠 Deep Learning ≠ Human Brain**

Neural networks are inspired by the brain, but they are **mathematical models**, not biological.
