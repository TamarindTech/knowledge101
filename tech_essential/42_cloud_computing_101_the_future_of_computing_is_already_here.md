# **☁️ Cloud Computing 101: The Future of Computing Is Already Here**

**💡 What Is Cloud Computing?**

**Cloud Computing** is the delivery of computing services — like servers, storage, databases, software, and analytics — **over the internet**, instead of on your local computer.

“It's like renting a supercomputer instead of buying one.”

**🧠 Why Cloud Computing?**

|**Benefit**|**Description**|
| :- | :- |
|💸 Cost-Effective|Pay-as-you-go pricing (no need to buy servers)|
|⚡ Scalable|Grow or shrink resources as needed|
|🌍 Accessible|Use from anywhere, on any device|
|🔒 Secure|Built-in security and backups|
|🚀 Fast Deployment|Launch apps in minutes|

**📦 Types of Cloud Services (The "X-as-a-Service" Model)**

|**Type**|**What You Get**|**Example Use Case**|
| :- | :- | :- |
|**IaaS** (Infrastructure as a Service)|Raw compute, storage, and networking|Deploy your own virtual server (e.g. AWS EC2)|
|**PaaS** (Platform as a Service)|Runtime + tools to build apps|Web app hosting without managing servers|
|**SaaS** (Software as a Service)|Ready-to-use apps via browser|Gmail, Google Docs, Zoom|
|**FaaS** (Function as a Service)|Run functions on demand (serverless)|Auto-resize images, chatbot webhooks|

**

**☁️ Deployment Models**

|**Model**|**Description**|**Example Use Case**|
| :- | :- | :- |
|**Public Cloud**|Shared infrastructure for many users|AWS, Azure, Google Cloud|
|**Private Cloud**|Infrastructure dedicated to one org|Banks, governments|
|**Hybrid Cloud**|Combines public and private clouds|Enterprises with strict policies|
|**Multi-Cloud**|Using services from multiple cloud vendors|App runs partly on AWS + Azure|

**🧰 Common Cloud Services**

|**Service Type**|**Example Tools**|**Purpose**|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Compute|AWS EC2, Azure VM, GCP GCE|Virtual servers|
|Storage|S3, Blob Storage, Cloud Storage|Store files, backups|
|Databases|RDS, Cosmos DB, Firestore|Store structured/unstructured data|
|DevOps & CI/CD|GitHub Actions, CodePipeline|Automate deployments|
|AI & ML|SageMaker, Azure ML, Vertex AI|Train and deploy models|
|Monitoring|CloudWatch, Azure Monitor|Observe metrics and logs|

**🧪 Real-Life Cloud Examples**

|**App / Tool**|**Cloud Use**|
| :- | :- |
|Netflix|Streams video using AWS cloud infrastructure|
|Google Docs|Documents stored and synced in the cloud|
|Zoom|Video calls managed across cloud regions|
|Instagram|Stores and serves photos from cloud servers|
|Spotify|Streams music using cloud + edge caching|
