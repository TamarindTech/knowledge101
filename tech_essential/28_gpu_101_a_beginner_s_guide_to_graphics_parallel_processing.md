# **🎮 GPU 101: A Beginner’s Guide to Graphics & Parallel Processing**

**💡 What Is a GPU?**

A **GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)** is a specialized processor designed to handle **many calculations at once**, especially those related to graphics, images, and **parallel data**.

🧠 While a CPU is a **general-purpose brain**, a GPU is a **muscle built for multitasking**.

**🧠 CPU vs GPU: What’s the Difference?**

|**Feature**|**CPU (Central Processing Unit)**|**GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)**|
| :- | :- | :- |
|🧠 Purpose|General computing (logic, OS, apps)|High-speed parallel math tasks|
|🔢 Cores|2–16 powerful cores|100s–1000s of smaller cores|
|🧮 Strength|Sequential, logic-heavy tasks|Matrix math, image/video processing|
|🎯 Used For|Web, apps, control flow|Graphics, deep learning, crypto|

🧠 Think of the CPU as a **smart executive**, and the GPU as a **giant team of assistants**.

**🖼️ Original Use: Rendering Graphics**

GPUs were first built to:

- Draw 2D & 3D **shapes and textures**
- Calculate **lighting, shadows, color blending**
- Update millions of **pixels** rapidly (frames/sec)

Used heavily in:\
🎮 Games | 🎥 Movies | 🧩 Design Software (CAD) | 🖌️ Animation

**🚀 The Rise of General Purpose GPUs (GPGPU)**

Modern GPUs can do **much more than graphics**. They now power:

- 🤖 **AI & Deep Learning**
- 🔬 **Scientific Simulations**
- 💱 **Cryptocurrency Mining**
- 📊 **Big Data Analytics**
- 🎧 **Real-time Video/Audio Processing**

This is called **GPGPU = General Purpose GPU Computing**

**🧩 GPU Architecture: How It Works**

|**Component**|**Function**|
| :- | :- |
|**Cores (ALUs)**|Tiny processors doing math in parallel|
|**SMs**|Streaming Multiprocessors (core clusters)|
|**Memory**|High-bandwidth for quick data access|
|**VRAM**|Dedicated video memory (e.g., 8GB GDDR6)|
|**Shaders**|Programs run by GPU to draw/render|

**🧮 Why GPUs Are Great for AI/ML**

|**AI Task**|**How GPU Helps**|
| :- | :- |
|Matrix multiplication|Processed in parallel|
|Training neural networks|1000s of weights adjusted at once|
|Handling large datasets|Big memory + many cores|
|Inference (predictions)|Run fast even on mobile GPUs|

Popular Libraries:

- **TensorFlow / PyTorch**
- Use **CUDA** (NVIDIA), **OpenCL**, or **Metal (Apple)** for GPU acceleration

**🛠️ Popular GPU Brands**

|**Brand**|**Product Line**|**Use Case**|
| :- | :- | :- |
|**NVIDIA**|GeForce, RTX, A100, H100|Gaming, AI, Data Centers|
|**AMD**|Radeon, Instinct|Gaming, workstations, servers|

**🧪 Try It Yourself**

1. **Check your GPU:**
   1. On Windows: Task Manager → Performance → GPU
   1. On Mac: About This Mac → Graphics
   1. On Linux: lspci | grep -i vga
1. **Try GPU acceleration (no install):**
   1. [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) → Runtime → Change to GPU
   1. Run a PyTorch or TensorFlow example
1. **Simple Code (Python + GPU):**

import torch

x = torch.rand(1000, 1000).cuda()  # Moves tensor to GPU
