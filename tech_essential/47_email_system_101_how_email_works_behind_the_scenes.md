# **📧 Email System 101: How Email Works Behind the Scenes**

**💡 What Is Email?**

**Email (Electronic Mail)** is a digital method of exchanging messages over the internet. It seems simple on the surface — but under the hood, a lot happens to deliver a message from your inbox to someone else’s.

“Email is like digital postal mail — sent via servers, sorted, routed, and delivered in seconds.”

**✉️ How Does Email Work?**

When you hit **"Send"**, here’s what happens:

1. **Compose & Send**
   1. You write an email in a client (e.g., Gmail, Outlook)
1. **Email is handed to an SMTP server**
   1. Your email provider uses **SMTP** (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) to send the message
1. **DNS finds the recipient’s mail server**
   1. Your system looks up **MX records** for the recipient's domain
1. **Mail is routed to the recipient’s mail server**
   1. The server receives and stores it
1. **Recipient retrieves email**
   1. Using **IMAP** or **POP3**, the recipient sees your message in their inbox

**🧪 Try It Yourself (Command-Line SMTP)**

If you’re curious, you can send a raw email via the command line:

telnet smtp.gmail.com 587

EHLO yourdomain.com

MAIL FROM:<you@example.com>

RCPT TO:<friend@example.com>

DATA

Subject: Test Email
