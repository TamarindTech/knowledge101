# **📊 DATA 101: Understanding the Fuel of the Digital World**

**💡 What Is Data?**

**Data** is information that can be **collected**, **stored**, and **analyzed** by computers.

Think of data like **raw ingredients** in cooking.\
You need them before you can make a dish (insights, decisions, or AI predictions).

**🧠 Why Is Data Important?**

- Every app, AI system, or website you use depends on **data** to work.
- Data helps us **understand the world**, **make decisions**, and **train AI**.

“In the 21st century, **data is the new oil.**” – It powers everything from social media to self-driving cars.

**🔍 Real-World Examples of Data**

|**Everyday Activity**|**The Data Being Used**|
| :- | :- |
|Listening on Spotify|Songs played, skip rates, genres you like|
|Using Google Maps|GPS location, time, road traffic|
|Posting on Instagram|Your photo, caption, likes, followers|
|Shopping online|Items viewed, added to cart, purchase history|
|Using ChatGPT|Your prompts and preferences|

**🧩 Types of Data (with Examples)**

|**Data Type**|**Description**|**Example**|
| :- | :- | :- |
|**Text**|Words and sentences|Comments, emails, tweets|
|**Numbers**|Quantitative values|Age = 21, Score = 95|
|**Images**|Visual data|Selfies, X-rays, satellite pics|
|**Audio**|Sound data|Voice notes, music files|
|**Categorical**|Group labels|Gender = Male/Female, Country|
|**Time Series**|Data collected over time|Daily temperature, stock prices|

**🗂️ How Is Data Stored?**

- **Tables (Spreadsheets/Databases)**\
  Rows = records (e.g., one person)\
  Columns = attributes (e.g., age, name)

Example:

|**ID**|**Name**|**Age**|**Country**|
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
|1|Aung|22|Myanmar|
|2|Sarah|19|Canada|

- **Files (Text, JSON, CSV, Excel)**
- **Cloud Databases** for apps and websites

**

**📚 What Do We Do With Data?**

|**Step**|**Description**|
| :- | :- |
|**Collect**|Gather data (surveys, sensors, logs)|
|**Clean**|Fix errors, remove duplicates|
|**Analyze**|Use charts, formulas, statistics|
|**Visualize**|Make data easy to understand|
|**Use**|Make decisions, train AI, optimize|

**🔄 How Data Powers AI**

AI learns from **examples**, and examples = **data**.

Example:

- Show AI 1000 images of cats + 1000 images of dogs
- It **learns patterns** and predicts if a new photo is a cat or a dog

More data = smarter AI.

**🧪 Mini Activity: "Your Daily Data"**

On a sheet or board, list 10 pieces of data generated by your phone today.

Examples:

- Number of steps walked
- What time you woke up
- Last photo you took
- Last 3 search terms

🎯 **Question**: If we collected this from 100 people, what could we learn?

**

**📊 Basic Data Visualization Types**

|**Chart Type**|**Best For...**|
| :- | :- |
|**Bar Chart**|Comparing values|
|**Pie Chart**|Showing parts of a whole|
|**Line Chart**|Tracking changes over time|
|**Scatter Plot**|Relationships between 2 variables|

**🧰 Tools to Explore Data**

|**Tool**|**Use Case**|
| :- | :- |
|**Google Sheets**|Easy data storage & charts|
|**Datawrapper**|Create beautiful charts|
|**Kaggle**|Datasets & coding challenges|
|**Teachable Machine**|Turn data into AI with no code!|

**🧠 Key Terms to Remember**

- **Dataset** – A collection of data
- **Label** – What you're trying to predict (e.g., "spam" or "not spam")
- **Feature** – A piece of input data (e.g., email length, keywords)
- **Model** – The AI system trained from data

**🚀 Final Thought**

“Without data, you’re just another person with an opinion.”\
– W. Edwards Deming

Learning how to work with data gives you superpowers to solve real problems.
